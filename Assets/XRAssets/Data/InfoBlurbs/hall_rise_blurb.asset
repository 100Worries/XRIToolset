  description: An Adaptable Living Unit, is a project that aims to find solutions
    for people living in impoverished coastal slums of Bangladesh, India. The area
    faces constant flooding, and monsoons and Rise seeks to develop a system that
    adapts to the flux of water levels and keeps its inhabitants safe and dry. Rise
    also aims to improve general living conditions for those living in slum communities
    by providing a living unit with proper plumbing, electricity, and sleeping components,
    all sustainable and self-sufficient within the unit.
