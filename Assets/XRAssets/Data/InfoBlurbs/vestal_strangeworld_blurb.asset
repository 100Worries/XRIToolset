  description: 'Strange World is the story of a young character named Mint, the story
    follows her through a journey of personal growth and exploration through the odd,
    confusing, and curious world where she finds herself.


    The story is metaphorical as it takes the reader through the five stages of grieving:
    denial, bargaining, sorrow, anger, and acceptance; each represented as a different
    obstacle for Mint.'
