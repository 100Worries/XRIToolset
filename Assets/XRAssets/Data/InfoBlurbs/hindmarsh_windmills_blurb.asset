  description: "The Windmills project is a unique adult coloring book that provides
    hours of stress relief, mindful calm, and fun, creative expression. For the HoloLens,
    the concept is to create a series of circle images from the coloring book and
    place as a hanging mobile twisting and turning in and around each other.\n\n<i>In
    order for you to see the sun, you\u2019ve got to clear the haze and confusion.
    If you want to feel like the clouds are parting and the sun is shining again,
    the first thing to do is unload your burdens.</i>"
