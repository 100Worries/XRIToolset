  description: "Turbulence is an experimental diagrammatic drawing and notation systems.
    The ability to see turbulence animated as a \u201Cholographic\u201D object gives
    a true insight into the complex movements in time and space of natural systems.
    Using 3D software, particles are emitted into a volume and affected by a computationally
    driven turbulent field. The trajectories of the particles are meshed into polygon
    objects and given material properties such as color and reflection."
